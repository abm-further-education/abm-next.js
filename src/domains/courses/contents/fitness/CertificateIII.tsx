      The SIS40221 Certificate IV in Fitness is perfect for anyone looking to
      become a personal trainer. You’ll learn how to design, instruct, and
      assess exercise programmes for healthy clients aiming to achieve their
      fitness goals. If a client has more serious health concerns, you’ll refer
      them to medical professionals. Personal trainers work independently, using
      their fitness knowledge in both routine and unpredictable situations, and
      communicate well with clients and health experts to achieve the best
      results.

      fitness centres, leisure facilities, client workplaces, homes, and even
      outdoors. You can train individuals or groups and may also provide online
      services. You could also step into leadership roles in some settings.
