        Are you ready to take your cookery skills to the next level?
      </h2>
      <p>
        At ABM Further Education, we offer a certificate IV in Kitchen
        Management that combines academic learning with practical experience.
        You will have the opportunity to work in real commercial kitchens, such
        as restaurants, hotels, and aged care facilities, and learn from the
        best in the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of your course, you will need to complete a mandatory work
        placement at the end of term 5 and throughout term 6. This is not just a
        requirement, but a chance for you to apply what you have learned in the
        classroom and gain valuable insights into the culinary world. You will
        be able to work the required hours in addition to your student visa
        requirements, so you don’t have to worry about that.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the work placement period, you will need to complete 60 shifts
        and a total of 30 hours per week. You will also need to complete two
        units of competency that will help you work effectively as a cook and
        coordinate cooking operations. Here is a breakdown of the units and the
        hours you need to complete:
