    description: `On 25th February, ABM proudly hosted its first on-campus graduation ceremony, marking a significant milestone as we celebrated our second group of 20 graduates. It was a truly special occasion, bringing together students, their families, and friends to honour their dedication, perseverance, and hard work. Seeing the graduates’ proud faces, filled with a well-earned sense of accomplishment, made the event all the more meaningful.

We extend our heartfelt congratulations to each graduate and wish them every success in their future careers and endeavours. Completing their studies is just the beginning of an exciting journey, and we have no doubt they will go on to achieve great things in the hospitality and fitness industries.

A special thank you goes to our Advanced Diploma of Hospitality Management students, whose professionalism and hospitality shone throughout the event. They prepared and served a selection of non-alcoholic beverages and delicious food to all guests, enhancing the celebratory atmosphere and making the occasion even more memorable.

We look forward to seeing many more students reach this incredible milestone in the future and can’t wait to celebrate their achievements together at ABM.
