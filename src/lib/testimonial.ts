      'This is my first time learning cooking, and the teachers are very kind. In practical class, the roles are well organised, so it\u2019s easy to follow. I\u2019ve been studying for 6 months now. Making bread, scones, salads, and learning different knife skills is intersting and fun. The theory is a bit difficult, but it\u2019s very helpful√•.',

I\u2019ve learned a lot about my body\u2019s limits and how to help others reach theirs too. ABM\u2019s experienced trainers and hands-on learning have made me more confident and skilled. I\u2019m ready to start working with my own clients when I return home this November and share everything I\u2019ve learned from ABM and Australia.`,

    message: `I chose the Fitness course at ABM because I wanted to study something I truly enjoy. I love working out, and ABM stood out as one of the few colleges offering face-to-face classes. I prefer in-person learning because I enjoy doing activities with other students. My trainers, Jonathon and Brayden, always give clear examples and keep us engaged. I also love that we regularly go to the gym and apply what we learn in class to real practice.`,
